		<h1>
			Convert to SQBS
		</h1>
		<p>
			This form allows you to convert UCSD scoresheets <b>generated by this site</b> into the standard SQBS file
			format.
		</p>


		<p>
			Note: This feature is experimental and should not be relied on. Use it at your own risk. <b>If you
				choose to use this feature, always have a person familiar with using SQBS on hand as a backup</b>, and
			be prepared to enter stats by hand (luckily, this is easy from the aggregate scoresheet!) I
			don't guarantee that I'll respond to requests for help using this feature.
		</p>

		<p>
			Limitations:
		<ul>
			<li>This feature only supports standard game lengths and point values: i.e. twenty tossups scored 15/10/-5,
				and twenty corresponding bonuses with three parts worth ten points each.</li>
			<li>Player names cannot be changed once the tournament starts, unless you manually change players' names in
				each of the room spreadsheets where they played. </li>
			<li>If room spreadsheets are incorrectly filled out, conversion may be incorrect; if it is incorrect, you
				might or might not be notified of that. Once again, always have a person who can use SQBS on hand, and
				make sure to check SQBS files and web reports before posting publicly.</li>
			<li>By design, this page will only send SQBS stats to the accounts that created scoresheets, and will
				only convert the last-created set of scoresheets. </li>
		</ul>
		</p>
