<h3>To generate aggregate scoresheets:</h3>

1. Make a copy of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gmsQzVvBeY9dTwEb1dBKyIITtMeeKVZd8TdNge20qaQ">master scoresheet template (latest revision 2/7/18)</a><br>
Your copy of the master scoresheet <i>will not</i> be directly modified. Thus it can be reused for multiple sets of scoresheets.
<br><br>
2. Make a copy of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kw8wlJ56xcbODJGTVNhU2_s65jTnzkPxkUMnLSXSRvw/">master aggregation sheet 
(latest revision 5/18/17)</a><br>
Like the master scoresheet, your copy of the aggregation sheet <i>will not</i> be directly modified.
<br><br>
3. If you want rosters in drop down menus, make a copy of a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13G76NL4sSlpnEGESli10PcQnXJs6NEcWTHLph8RSvAY">roster sheet</a><br> 
Unlike the previous two sheets, this spreadsheet will not be copied. Thus you will need one for every set of scoresheets you want to generate (i.e. one per division/bracket). Note that there is a <b>maximum of 6 total players per team if rosters are used</b>. Teams with more than 6 players in total are not supported at this time. 
<br><br>
Record the spreadsheet IDs of each of your copies of the sheet. The spreadsheet ID is the set of numbers and letters (case sensitive) after the "/d/" in the URL of a spreadsheet. The spreadsheet ID is highlighted in the below example:
<br>
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<b style="color:red">13G76NL4sSlpnEGESli10PcQnXJs6NEcWTHLph8RSvAY</b>/edit#gid=0
<br>
It is recommended to place all three (two if you aren't using rosters) copies of the master spreadsheets into a single folder in your Google Drive.
<br>
<b>Share the folder containing all three spreadsheets--giving edit permissions--with qbscoresheets@gmail.com</b>
<br><br>
4. <a target="_blank" href="/create">Click here</a> (opens in new tab) to go to the scoresheet creation form. Fill in the appropriate fields, using the IDs of the scoresheets from steps 1-3. An email will be sent to the address in the "notification email" field when scoresheet creation is done. Contact Jonathan Luck if you don't have an access code. Put in your list of rooms, either comma separating the room names, or putting one room on each line. If you enter more rooms than you are going to use, it is recommended to put rooms you are most likely to use at the beginning of the list. Finally, enter the number of rounds you need aggregation for. Typically, this is 1-2 more than the number of rounds you plan on running. There is a maxiumum of 16 rounds allowed at this time.


<h3>After aggregate scoresheets are generated:</h3>

1. Go to the newly-created aggregate scoresheet (link in the notification email). For each room, you'll need to link the scoresheets. Do so by clicking on the ERROR or #REF message in a cell, and hitting the "Allow Access" button. Example:
<br><br>

<br><br>

If you are not using rosters, you are done. You can now use your scoresheets. <b>If you are using rosters, you must perform the following steps:</b><br><br>

2. Go to the roster sheet. Team names should go in column A. The next 6 columns are for player names. Column H is used for bracket names. Note that even if a team has less than 6 players, bracket names must go in column H. Before proceeding to step 3, it is recommended to fill in at least a placeholder team and player. Example:<br><br>

<br><br>
3. Lastly, you must go into each of the room scoresheets (spreadsheets named after each room you provided in the scoresheet creation form) and go to the "Rosters" sheet (rightmost tab on the bottom after all the Round X's). Link each scoresheet to the roster spreadsheet. If you filled in a placeholder team, it should appear shortly after linking them.
