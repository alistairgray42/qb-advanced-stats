<h3>Highly experimental SQBS file conversion:</h3>

Note: This feature is highly experimental and should not be relied upon. Use it at your own risk. <b>If you choose to use this feature, always have a person familiar with using SQBS on-hand as a backup.</b> I will not respond to requests for help using this feature. 
<br><br>
Limitations:
<ul>
<li>This feature does not support tournaments with variable or non-standard (not 20) numbers of tossups heard.</li>
<li>This feature only supports standard point values (e.g. 15, 10, -5) </li>
<li>Roster sheets generated using the above tool <b>must</b> be used. </li>
<li>Names in the roster sheets cannot be changed once the tournament starts (unless you want go into each of the room spreadsheets where a player played in and change their names)</li>
<li>Liable to not work if there are problems with the way the room spreadsheets are filled out. If it does not convert properly, you may not be notified. Once again, always have a person who can use SQBS on-hand.</li>
</ul>
How to use the SQBS file conversion (link opens in new tab):
<ol>
<li>Paste in the sheet ID of the aggregation spreadsheet that was <b>generated</b>. This is not the master spreadsheet ID or the ID of your copy. This is the ID of the sheet that was created by the program.</li>

<li>Provide a notification email</li>

<li>Enter the number of rounds that have been completed at this point.</li>

<li>Enter the number of rooms that are actually being used (this may be less than the number of room spreadsheets generated)</li>

<li>Mark if the set is using powers. Mark if you are using brackets (divisions). If you are using brackets, make sure your bracket names are in column H of the roster spreadsheet. </li>
</ol>
